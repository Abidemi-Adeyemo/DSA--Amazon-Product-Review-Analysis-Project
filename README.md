# DSA-Capstone-Project

 This is my first Portfolio Building Project after my Data Analysis Class with the Incubator Hub.

I have been taught how to analyse data using the MS Excel, SQL and Power BI. I also learnt Portfolio building.

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis Project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E-commerce project over the year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.  

### Data Source
The primary source of data used here is Amazon case study .xlsx, from Amazon

•       Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings

stored as comma-separated values
