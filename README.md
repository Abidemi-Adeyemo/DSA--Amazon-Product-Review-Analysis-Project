# DSA-Capstone-Project

 This is my first Portfolio Building Project after my Data Analysis Class with the Incubator Hub.

I have been taught how to analyse data using the MS Excel, SQL and Power BI. I also learnt Portfolio building.

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis Project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E-commerce project over the year. By analysing the various parameters in the dataset received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement.  

### Data Source
The primary source of data used here is Amazon case study .xlsx, from Amazon

###  Dataset Description 
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including: 

•       Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 

•       Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 

•       Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data 
stored as comma-separated values 
Total Records: 1,46
TotalFields: 16 columns

### Tools Used
MS Excel - (Power Query, Pivot table, Charts on Dashboard) 

### Analysis Task
This Analysis does Justice to the following: 

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category? 
2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?  
4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 
4.0, etc.)? 
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, 
₹200–₹500, >₹500)? 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts? 
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

15. ### Analysis

### Findings
Electronics, Computers & Accessories, and Home & Kitchen top the charts for product count and engagement.  
Electronics has the highest number of reviews while Car & Motorbike has the lowest 
Products in the Smartwatches and In-Ear categories have highest average ratings.  
Home Improvement shows the highest discount percentage.  
Computer & Accessories generated the highest actual revenue potential.  
Products with high discounts still maintain high ratings, indicating a positive impact of discounting on customer satisfaction.  
Majority of products are rated 4.0–4.5, showing high customer satisfaction.  

### Recommendations
1. Products with very high ratings but low reviews should be promoted to boost awareness.
2. Electronics and Accessories drive the most review. Invest more in inventory, marketing, and customer experience in these categories.
3. While discounts drive engagement, high discounts result in significant revenue loss. Aim for a balance
4. Combine weaker products with stronger ones in bundles to improve sales volume without impacting individual revenue margins too deeply.
